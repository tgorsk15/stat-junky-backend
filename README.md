Welcome to the backend of the Stat Junky site!

This backend was built using Node.js and Express, while being deployed 
formally on an EC2 instance through AWS

**The API this backend uses to gather data and send to the front end
is the [BallDontLie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/)

You can visit the data site on the web at the public site:
